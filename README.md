## Overview

The challenge is to build your own clone of a Trello board in 4 hours. It’s encouraged that you do
it in one go and commit changes to the git repo frequently.

- A user should be able to add and label columns.
- A user should be able to add and edit cards.
- A user should be able to move cards between columns (UX is up to you, does not need to be
  drag-and-drop).
- Do make sure the available interactions are intuitive. In other words, we will be considering
  usability. - Some kind of persistency(LocalStorage or SessionStorage) is encouraged, though not
  required.

## Requirements

- The UI is responsive ✅
- No use of libraries ✅
- Fully working mini clone of trello ✅

## Review

Short-comings: no testing

## Todo
